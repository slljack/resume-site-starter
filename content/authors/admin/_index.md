I'm a Master student at Stony Brook University majoring in Computer Science. My current interests include Algorithms, Machine Learning. Most of my works are done in Java, Python, and C, but I am also experienced with other languages specified on my [resume](uploads/resume.pdf). I am looking for a software development internship for Summer 2023.
